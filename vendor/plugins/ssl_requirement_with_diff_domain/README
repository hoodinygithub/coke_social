SSL Requirement With Diff Domain
================================

SSL Requirement adjusts to allow diff domains (only subdomains with or without paths).

Example:

  class ApplicationController < ActiveRecord::Base
    include SslRequirementWithDiffDomain
    ssl_required_object :current_site    
    
    def current_site
      Site.find_by_host(request.host)
    end    
  end

  class AccountController < ApplicationController
    ssl_required_with_diff_domain :signup, :payment
    ssl_allowed_with_diff_domain :index
    
    def signup
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end
    
    def payment
      # Non-SSL access will be redirected to SSL
    end

    def index
      # This action will work either with or without SSL
    end

    def other
      # SSL access will be redirected to non-SSL
    end
  end
  
You can overwrite the protected method ssl_required? to rely on other things
than just the declarative specification. Say, only premium accounts get SSL.    

You can overwrite the protected method ssl_domain to call the right columns 
from your site object. By default `domain` and `ssl_domain` it's used.

P.S.: Beware when you include the SslRequirement module. At the time of
inclusion, it'll add the before_filter that validates the declarations. Some
times you'll want to run other before_filters before that. They should then be
declared ahead of including this module.
